# MVVM Architecture in Flutter

This repository provides an example of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern implemented in a Flutter project. MVVM separates the presentation layer from the business logic and data layer, making the app more modular, maintainable, and testable.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **models/**: Defines data models that represent the application's data structure.
- **views/**: Contains UI components, implemented as Flutter widgets.
- **view_models/**: Houses ViewModel classes that handle the interaction between views and models.
- **services/**: Contains business logic and data fetching services.
- **main.dart**: Entry point for the Flutter application.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/UmarShahid361/MVVM.git

    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```shell

    flutter run
    ```

## Usage
